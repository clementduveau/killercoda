This was a brief demo of the LGTM stack, Alloy and OpenTelemetry. Feel free to [reach out](https://linkedin.com/in/duveau) and [contribute](https://github.com/clementduveau/killercoda)

I am looking for help to add the following things in this tutorial:
- [ ] Manual instrumentation (count the cumulative value of all rolls ?)
- [ ] Add some dashboard to better display "There is nothing / There is something"
- [ ] Add some diagrams for explanations
- [ ] Better examples of metrics stored
- [ ] Other Zero Code instrumentations (PHP, JS...)
