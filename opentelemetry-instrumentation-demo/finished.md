I am looking for help/time to add the following things in this tutorial:

- Add a dashboard to better display "There is nothing / There is something"
- Add some diagrams for explanations
- Better examples of metrics stored
- Custom Instrumentation
    - Manual instrumentation (count the cumulative value of all rolls ?)
    - Creating custom spans with attributes
- Sampling
    - Implementing tail-based sampling
    - Using attribute-based sampling decisions ?
- PII obfuscation
