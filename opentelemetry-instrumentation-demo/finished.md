# Congratulations

This was a brief demo of the LGTM stack, Alloy and OpenTelemetry. Feel free to [reach out](https://linkedin.com/in/duveau) and [contribute](https://github.com/clementduveau/killercoda)

I am looking for help/time to add the following things in this tutorial:
- Manual instrumentation (count the cumulative value of all rolls ?)
- Better monitoring of errors: get traces with 404
- Add a dashboard to better display "There is nothing / There is something"
- Add some diagrams for explanations
- Add the k6 steps to get continuous traffic
- Better examples of metrics stored
