# OpenTelemetry instrumentation

This scenario installs Grafana, Tempo, Prometheus and Loki.

In the first steps, the user will discover the Grafana stack, and Alloy to create observability pipelines

Once done, we will instrument a dummy application named _Rolldice_ with _Zero code instrumentation_ from OpenTelemetry.

Finally, we will create a manual instrumentation in the code.
