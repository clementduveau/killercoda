# IMPORTANT !!!

This workshop is **deprecated** because it has been donated to [Grafana Labs](https://killercoda.com/grafana-labs/course/otel). I am maintaining it there and already plan some upgrades. This lab stays online in case you came through an old link that I shared during a presentation.


# OpenTelemetry Instrumentation

This scenario demonstrates OpenTelemetry Zero Code instrumentation in Java. It installs Loki, Grafana, Tempo, and Mimir. Then, it guides you through configuring Alloy and launching a sample application named _Rolldice_.
