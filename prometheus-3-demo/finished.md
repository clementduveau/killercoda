# Conclusion

You've started a monitoring stack with Prometheus 3, inspected its configuration, queried metrics from node_exporter, and explored recording rules and new features.

Next steps you can try locally:

- Add another exporter (for example, `blackbox_exporter`) to scrape targets over HTTP.
- Create more recording rules and alerting rules and integrate them into Alertmanager.
- Upgrade the Prometheus version and observe performance differences on your data.

Thanks for trying the demo!
